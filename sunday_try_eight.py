# This script creates two separate threads for opening new Notepad windows using the 
# `subprocess.call()` function to create new processes. 
# In each of the new Notepad windows, 
# the script creates a text file with today's date and the contents of the `random_name` variable.
# The file is then saved with a file name that includes a formatted date and the contents of the 
# `random_name` variable with two underscores separating them. Finally, the script changes the focus
# back to the first Notepad window.

# Regarding SOLID principles, Uncle Bob emphasizes the importance of open-closed and 
# single-responsibility principles in ensuring that code is flexible and easily maintainable.
# In this script, we have separated the concerns of opening notepad windows and creating text
# files into separate functions, which follows the single-responsibility principle. 
# We are also following the open-closed principle by using the `subprocess.call()` function, 
# which allows this script to be easily extensible to other commands as needed.
