The hardware that the code is driving consists of multiple sets of 64 pixels, with each set being addressed as a single 64-pixel-wide "panel." Each panel is connected to the next to form a chain. Given that, the `MapVisibleToMatrix()` function maps the incoming visible pixels to the pixels on the individual panels in the chain. The output from the function shows that when `incoming_x` is 63, that pixel is on the last virtual pixel column of the first panel in the chain. In the code implementation of `getPanelOffsets()`, if the incoming pixel's y-coordinate is greater than or equal to 32, then that pixel is on the second panel in the chain, as each panel is 32 pixels tall. Therefore, when `incoming_x` is 63 and `incoming_y` is 0, the pixel has reached the end of the first panel and it should move to the first pixel column of the second panel, which is at `new_x: 0, new_y: 1`.
